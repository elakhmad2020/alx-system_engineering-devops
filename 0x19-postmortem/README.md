Postmortem: Docker Installation Failure on Ubuntu
Issue Summary:

Duration: This issue prevented Docker installation for an unspecified duration.
Impact: Engineers were unable to proceed with development and testing workflows that rely on Docker containers.
Root Cause: A dependency conflict between the Docker package and the pre-installed Ubuntu system.
Timeline:

2:00PM: The issue was identified when an engineer attempted to install Docker using the standard apt-get install docker command. The installation failed with error messages.
3:00PM: Investigation began, focusing on the error messages and potential configuration issues with the package manager.
7:00PM: Initial troubleshooting assumed missing dependencies or corrupted package cache. Standard solutions like apt-get update and apt-get clean were attempted without success.
3:00AM: The investigation escalated to the infrastructure team due to the possibility of a broader system configuration issue.
Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the issue was a dependency conflict. A specific system package pre-installed on Ubuntu was incompatible with the desired Docker version.

Resolution: The infrastructure team identified the conflicting package and provided two options:
Remove the conflicting package (if not critical for other functionalities).
Use a different Docker installation method, like downloading a pre-built binary package from the official Docker repository.
The engineering team opted for the second option to avoid potential system instability by removing an unknown package. The Docker installation proceeded successfully using the downloaded binary package.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improve documentation: The development team documentation will be updated to include alternative Docker installation methods, alongside the standard apt-get approach. This will provide engineers with a fallback option in case of dependency conflicts.

Dependency checks: Explore the possibility of implementing automated dependency checks during the development environment setup process. This could involve tools or scripts that identify potential conflicts between Docker and the system configuration before encountering installation failures.
Monitoring: Consider implementing monitoring for package management operations. This could involve logging attempts to install Docker and capturing any associated errors. This data can be used for future troubleshooting and identifying recurring issues.

Additional Notes:

Include the specific error messages encountered during the installation failure in the internal documentation for future reference.
If applicable, document the specific conflicting package that caused the issue and the chosen resolution method (removal or alternative installation).
